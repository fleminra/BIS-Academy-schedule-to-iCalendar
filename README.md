This Python script extracts game times from

https://boulderindoorsoccer.com/bis-academy/bis-schedules/

and generates `.ics` files for each team.

That web page appears to be generated by [SportsPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sportspress/).

The SportsPress page indicates that that plugin does have "Events
Integrate with iCal." So if Boulder Indoor Soccer could make that
work, this script probably wouldn't be needed.
